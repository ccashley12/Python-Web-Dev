Model updates:

The model for the Recipe Collection will
remain the same, but I will add a pic
attribute for each recipe to have
an image. I will also be adding an
additional app for Users, which will at
least consist of a username and pic attribute.
I plan to add attributes for
password and web token, if necessary.

Frontend Inspirations:

I am taking some design inspirations from ReciMe. ReciMe organizes all your favorite 
recipes in one place. Save recipes from Instagram, Pinterest, Tiktok and Facebook. 
Create grocery lists and meal plans. Calculate calories for every recipe. 
The design of the app is very uniform and easy to navigate. Also lots of fun features for Users
to utilize.

Another inspiration for my app is Kitchen Stories easy Recipes. Beautiful and polished, 
it presents a rich variety of recipes, all backed by dazzling photos, helpful videos, 
and handy tips. You can even pick a recipe while youâ€™re on the go and get an automatically generated.
shopping list to take to the grocery store on the way home. The design of this app is very interactive 
and aesthetically pleasing to view. Also very easy to navigate with a clean and simple design.
