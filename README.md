**Recipe App (Command Line Version)**

Users will be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Users will also be able to search for recipes by their ingredients.

***Key Features***

- Create and manage the user’s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database. 
- Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user. 
- Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level. 
 Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty of the recipe.

**Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming**
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux 
- Create and manage virtual environments 
- Use pip to install and manage packages

**Exercise 2: Data Types In Python**
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their own internal data 
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

**Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python**
- Create your first script on a .py script file
- Build a script that uses if-elif-else statements, for loops, and functions to take recipes from the user then display them

**Exercise 4: File Handling in Python**
- Create a Python script that takes recipes from the user and writes the data in a binary file
- Create another script that reads the binary file and lists out the available ingredients. The user chooses an ingredient and the script displays all recipes which contain it
- Use Python’s exception handling features to handle common errors

**Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python**
- Build a custom class for your recipes, which contains its own data attributes for name, ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, as well as other custom methods to interact with this data
